# oddstream

> One Direction Data Stream

A library to easily apply a unidirectional dataflow in your apps with RxJS.

## Install

`npm install --save-dev oddstream`

## Usage

```js
import { OddStream } from 'oddstream';

const oddStream = new OddStream();
```

### Set Action Creators
Pass all action creators to the OddStream library.
Preferably in the code of the main component that contains the rest of your app.

```js
// A collection of action creators.
const actionCreators = {
  deleteItem: id => ({ type: 'DELETE_ITEM', data: { id }}),
  addItem: item => ({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', data: { item }}),
  // ...
};

oddStream.setActionCreators(actionCreators);
```

### Dispatch Actions
In your components dispatch action by passing
an action stream and the action name or constant.

```js
buttonClick$ = Rx.Observable.fromEvent('.some-button', click);
oddStream.dispatch(buttonClick$, 'BUTTON_CLICK');
```

### Create A State Stream Based On Reducers
In a file that you could call Store or something,
create and expose state streams for you different components
by passing the respective reducers.

Here is also the place where you can combine state streams if they
depend on one another.

```js
// A collection of reducers.
const reducers = {
  deleteItem: (action, state) => state
    .filter(item => state.filter(item.id !== action.data.id)),
  addItem: (action, state) => [...state, action.data],
  // ...
};

someComponentState$ = oddStream.makeStateStream(reducers, initialState);
```

### Trigger Side Effects
You can trigger your side effects by getting the dispatcher stream
and firing effects on specific actions.

When the side effects are done, they themselves can fire actions
to introduce new changes to the user interface.

```js
// An api to fire certain side effects.
const serverApi = new serverApi();
const dispatcher$ = getDispatcher$();

dispatcher$
  .do(action => {
    switch(action.type) {
      case 'DELETE_ITEM':
        serverApi.deleteItem(action.data);
        break;
      case 'ADD_ITEM':
        serverApi.addItem(action.data);
        break;
    }
  });
```
