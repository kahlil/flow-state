# oddstream

> One Direction Data Stream

A simple Redux-type library entirely based on RxJS streams.  
This is an easy way to introduce a stream-based unidirectional dataflow into your app.

## Install

`npm install oddstream`

## Usage

```js
import { createOddstream } from 'oddstream';

const oddstream = createOddstream();
```

### Dispatch Actions
In your components dispatch actions by passing the action constant and optionally
an action payload. The payload can be any value.

```js
oddstream.dispatch('SOME_ACTION', { some: 'state' });
```

### Create A State Stream Based On Reducers
In a file that you could call Store,
create and expose state streams for your components
by passing the respective reducers.

Here is also the place where you can combine state streams if they
depend on one another.

```js
// A collection of reducers.
const itemListReducers = {
  deleteItem: (action, state) => state
    .filter(item => state.filter(item.id !== action.payload.id)),
  addItem: (action, state) => [...state, action.payload],
  // ...
};

itemListState$ = oddstream.makeStateStream(itemListReducers, initialState);
```

In your component you can now subscribe to the component state stream: 

```js
itemListState$.subscribe(state => console.log(state));
```

### Trigger Side Effects
You can trigger your side effects similar to redux-observable 
by listening to the actions stream, triggering your side effect 
and return a new action.

Each side effect is a function and has to be passed to 
`oddstream.runSideEffects`. 

The action that the result of each side effect maps to

```js
// An api to fire certain side effects.
const serverApi = new serverApi();

const sideEffect1 = action$ => action$
  .filter(action => action.type === 'SOME_ACTION')
  .switchMap(action => serverApi.deleteItem(action.payload))
  .map(response => ({ type: 'RESPONSE_ACTION1', payload: response }));

const sideEffect1 = action$ => action$
  .filter(action => action.type === 'SOME_ACTION')
  .switchMap(action => serverApi.addItem(action.payload))
  .map(response => ({ type: 'RESPONSE_ACTION1', payload: response }));

oddstream.runSideEffects(sideEffect1, sideEffect2);
```
